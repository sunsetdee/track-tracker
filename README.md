# Track Tracker

## Track Tracker is a website that you can add a race track(fictional, a track from video game or real world race track)and give comments, rating and difficulty based on your experience. You can view other user's comment and see their thoughts and takes on a race track regardless if it's a real race track or a race track in a video game.

## The technologies I've used for this project are
1. HTML to render the text and navigation bar you are seeing you are seeing .
2. CSS for the images and styling that are second to none. 
3. Javascript for codes that make this page work.
4. Node.js and its framework Express to run Javascript.
5. MongoDB and its library Mongoose to store our data.
6. Google OAuth to login with your Google credential.
7. Heroku to deploy and host our app.

## To get connected to this app, please click on this link [Track Tracker](https://track-tracker-sei.herokuapp.com/ "Track Tracker Home Page"). Once you are in the main page, you can login with your Google credential and start adding track and review. Here is another link to my Trello board for this project's planning that include Icebox, MVP, Wireframe and ERD [Trello Planning Board](https://trello.com/b/8k85Trwo/project-2-planning "Trello")

## For future enhancements
1. I would like to be able to give the users the ability to add images to each track.
2. I would alos like to let users upload videos of the tracks.
